# PostCSS

PostCSS is a tool for transforming [[CSS]] styles with [[JavaScript|JS]] plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, trasnpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.

PostCSS takes a CSS file and provides an [[API]] to analyze and modify its rules (by transforming them into an [[Abstract Syntax Tree]]). This API can then be used to find errors automatically, insert vendor prefixes, etc..
