# Razor Pages
Razor Pages is a [[Server-Side]] [[Cross-Platform|cross-platform]], [[Open Source|open source]] web development framework from Microsoft that lets us use [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]], with [[CSharp|C#]] to build modern page focused web applications.

Since Razor Pages is a page-focused framework, it's primary purpose is to generate HTML. Any kind of web application can be built using Razor Pages and it is particularly suitable for forms-based applications such as [[CRUD]] apps.

Razor Pages is an implementation of the [[MVC]] pattern that uses the Page Controller. HTML is generated dynamically from the server based on templates.
