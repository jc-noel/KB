# What Is Razor
Razor is an [[ASP.NET]] programming syntax used to create dynamic web pages with [[CSharp|C#]] programming language.

The Razor syntax is a template markup syntax that enables the programmer to use an [[HTML]] construction workflow.

The idea behind Razor is to provide an optimized syntax for HTML generation using a code-focused templating approach, with minimal transition between HTML and code.
