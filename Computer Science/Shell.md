# Shell
In computing, a **shell** is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a [[Command-Line Interface]] (CLI) or [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
