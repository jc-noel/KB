# Asynchrony

**Asynchrony**, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events.

These may be "outside" events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that takes place concurrently with program execution, without the program *blocking* to wait for results.
